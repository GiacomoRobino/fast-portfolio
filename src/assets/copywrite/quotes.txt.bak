What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.”
— Charles M. Strauss

“Some people, when confronted with a problem, think ‘I know, I’ll use regular expressions.’  Now they have two problems.”

“I think computer viruses should count as life.  I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive.  We’ve created life in our own image.”
— Stephen Hawking
   
“The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards.”
